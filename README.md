```
WorldChunkTool by MHVuze

Usage: WorldChunkTool <chunkN_file> (PKGext)

PKGext: use 'false' to turn off PKG file extraction, defaults to 'true'
```

*oo2core_5_win64.dll* required. Copy it from the install directory of Monster Hunter: World to the same folder as the WorldChunkTool executable.

**Warning:** You need A LOT of space to decompress huge chunkN.bin files. To be sure, calculate 3 * chunkN.bin size. Also, large files will take a while to process. Just be aware and let the tool do its thing.
